      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kyle Train Depot and Heritage Center offers a wealth of historical
knowledge, and should be a very tempting venue for history
enthusiasts.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sachi and Saurav are expecting their first baby and are excited for
her arrival. This is their second baby bump photoshoot with me. I am
honored to be documenting this special milestone with them.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Raynav&amp;rsquo;s first photoshoot, along with his proud &lt;a href=/post/and-then-there-were-three/&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out photographing a baby is difficult, as the expressions and
poses cannot be controlled. The only control you generally have is the
lighting and positioning the baby.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sachi and Saurav are expecting their first baby in July 2017!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure we will be shooting a lot more pregnancy pictures as the day
comes closer.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shriti and Naresh are expecting their first child in March. They
wanted me to take some pictures to document their pregnancy. We wanted
to go to a park to take these pictures but, Austin&amp;rsquo;s erratic winter
weather put damper on our plans and we had to postpone few times.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maicha is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newar_language&#34;&gt;Newari&lt;/a&gt;
word, which means &lt;em&gt;a young girl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saisha was gifted this beautiful traditional Newari costume by her
maternal grandmother&amp;rsquo;s friend, back in May. She wore this costume for
her daycare&amp;rsquo;s United Nation&amp;rsquo;s day celebration.  However, we took
advantage of the long Thanksgiving weekend to take Saisha&amp;rsquo;s pictures
in this attire.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sudixa and I have been talking about a witch flying on a broom theme
for a long time. I am glad we were finally able to shoot the theme
just in time for Halloween.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first try on levitation photography can be seen on this part of the
post. Editing was not as hard as I thought it would be. Good results
can be achieved with simple editing with Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Rebecca and Brendan for coming fully prepared for the
photo-shoot. It is always a pleasure working with ya&amp;rsquo;all.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Sachi for graduating from Texas A&amp;amp;M with Masters in
Accounting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among my photograph subjects you are one of those who has always
supported my efforts &amp;mdash; enthusiastically.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friends Sachi and Saurav have been happily married for four years,
and still going strong. They are always willing to help me learn and
test new ideas, for which I am grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shots taken below used a simple three lights setup, with the third
acting as a background light.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First time I heard of flow posing was while I watching Sue Bryce&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.creativelive.com/courses/glamour-photography-sue-bryce&#34;&gt;Glamour Photography&lt;/a&gt;
on CreativeLive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understood the advantage of flow posing, but it took me time to
incorporate into the work flow.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using a second strobe as a rim light will separate the subject from a
background. Separation is especially useful if the background is dark,
or while shooting at night.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was very excited about shooting fireworks this Independence
Day. With an hour of research, I came up a list you might want to
consider while shooting fireworks.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the continuation of my previous &lt;a href=/post/one-light-setup/&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Here, I also use a single
strobe to take a portrait. But, this time its an indoor portrait of my
beautiful wife Sudixa.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been salivating over Oliphant Studio&amp;rsquo;s
backdrops. They are piece of art, and look good on portraits. However,
they aren&amp;rsquo;t for everyone, as price ranges from couple to few a
thousand dollars.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was &lt;a href=/post/art-of-posing/&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt; to
shoot using pocket strobe, I was under the impression, as most people
are, that more means better. Although, I knew about the concept of
&lt;em&gt;chiaroscuro&lt;/em&gt; (use of shadow and light in an art, used since the
Renaissance period), this seemingly simple concept took a while to
sink in.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rebecca and Brendan are into acro yoga. As stated in my &lt;a
href=/post/inner-peace/&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, both of
them have been practicing the art for few years, which is quite
apparent in the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to have a clear sky on a Saturday morning, which
is getting very rare these days in Austin, Texas.

      <title>The Art of Posing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought my first DSLR five years ago, it was a Nikon D3000. Shooting
in automatic mode was easy and intuitive, but the pictures weren&amp;rsquo;t
that good.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love shooting during sunset, it gives picture a magical look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, shooting in the dusk, especially with the sun in the background,
comes with its own challenges. There are few ways to shoot around the
constraints:
